# delaunify
**delaunify** is a command-line tool to perform 2D [Delaunay
triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) on a set
of points. It is designed to be a simple
[filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(software)) that accepts point
coordinates streamed in via stdin, then outputs the vertex indices of the
generated triangles to stdout.

delaunify uses the
[Geogram](http://alice.loria.fr/software/geogram/doc/html/index.html) library
by Bruno LÃ©vy, specifically its Delaunay PSM (pluggable software module, a
library standalone autogenerated from the Geogram source tree). The Geogram
version included here is currently 1.6.4.
